Developed in collaboration between the [Embodied Visualization Group](https://www.monash.edu/it/hcc/embodied-visualisation) at Monash University, David Rumsey, and the David Rumsey Map Center, [Globes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/globes/id6480082996) is an App for Apple Vision Pro that allows users to explore a curated selection of 3D, high-resolution globes from the David Rumsey Map Collection.

A broad overview of the app's development can be found [here](https://dilpreet.co/projects/globes).


# Globes Features

Globes allows users to view, place, and manipulate high-resolution digital renditions of globes from the David Rumsey Map Collection in physical space. The app also allows for animations that cycle through users' favorite globes, and for immersive, full-360° panoramas.

## Features and Gestures

**Place one or multiple globes in your physical space**\
Select the white globe icon below your desired globe to have it appear in front of you. Selecting additional globes will furhter populate the space around you and will not replace the first globe you opened.

**Move globes around you**\
Pinch and drag globes to freely move them in the space around you.

**Pause/resume globe auto-rotation**\
By default, newly opened globes are set to auto-rotoate. To pause or resume this auto-rotation, quickly pinch twice in a row with one hand (think: double tap).

**Resize globes as desired**\
To enlarge globes, pinch and drag apart with both hands. To shrink them, pinch and drag together with both hands.

**Rotate globes around their axes**\
Pinch and hold with one hand until the globe stops its auto-rotation, then drag left or right to rotate it around its axis. *Note: a globe does not have to be rotating to use this feature, however, it can be difficult to determine how long to hold before dragging if it is not.*

**3D rotate globes**\
To freely rotate a globe hold one hand in front of the other, pinch with both hands, and then move your hands in opposite directions (apart or together vertically or horizontally).

**Animate a globe to cycle through a chosen selection**\
Select the play button icon from the left menu bar to bring up the animate tab. Then, select the play icon below the "Animate" heading to begin the animation. You can choose from preset categories along the top of the menu, or you can create your own selection by choosing to cycle through your favorites. To add a globe to your favorites list, select the heart icon below the globe on the main menu. 

**View globes as immersive panoramas**\
Select the rectangular panorama icon below a globe to view it as an immersive, 360° image. Within this view, pinch and drag left or right to rotate the globe around you.
