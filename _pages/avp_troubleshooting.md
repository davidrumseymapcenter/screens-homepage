Here you will find information on common and recurring issues affecting the Apple Vision Pro.

# Vision Pro not Turning On

If you put on the Vision Pro and only see a black screen, first make sure it has a charge. Tap the battery pack and a light by the cord should illuminate green or orange. If no light illuminates, the headset is out of battery and will need to be plugged in.

# Selection Difficulty

If the headset is not accurately tracking a visitor's gaze, they will have difficulty navigating the UI of the headset. To redo the hand and eye calibration process, quintuple-click the top button and use the digital crown to scroll down to "redo hand and eye setup." Select this option by clicking the digital crown, and the visitor will be guided through the hand and eye setup process again.
