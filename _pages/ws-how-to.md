Here you will find a guide on how to operate the DRMC wall screens and CineNet configuration tablets.

# Audio

All audio settings are found by selecting the "Audio" icon on the right-hand side bar of the 4x4 CineNet tablet. Doing so will bring up a menu that looks like this:

**Audio Input**\
To change the source of the center speakers audio output, select the relevant input source from the list of inputs. "4x4" refers to the 4x4 bravo computer, and "BYOD" refers to any external computer plugged into the BYOD HDMI cable on the podium. 

To play audio from BYOD, you may need to configure the audio output on the external computer by routing it through "Tesiraforte."

"WEPRESENT 1" through "WEPRESENT 6" refer to legacy devices that are left over from the system before the 2021 refresh. They are no longer operational.

**Presentation Audio**\
Below the input source list is a menu section labeled "Presentation Audio." This is where you turn speakers and microphones on and off and adjust their input and output levels.

**Speakers**\
The speaker section contains an on/off toggle and a volume slider. Flipping the toggle to "ON" will turn the center speakers on and flipping it to "OFF" will turn them off.

The volume slider allows you to adjust the master volume of the speakers themselves. You can either tap the volume up or volume down icons on either side of the slider to adjust the volume incrementally, or tap/tap and drag the slider itself to adjust the volume directly. 

Turning the volume slider all the way down functionally works the same as flipping the toggle to "OFF," though it is best practice to use the toggle instead of the slider to mute the center speakers.

**All Mics**\
Below the speaker section is the portable microphone section, which includes the all handheld microphones and lapel microphones. Note that handheld microhpnes must be charged and turned on for microphone audio to be passed to the center speakers. The "SPEAKERS" toggle in this section enables/disables passthrough of the microphone output to the center speakers, while the "MICROPHONES" toggle enables/disables the microphone input audio. Setting either of these toggles to "off" functionally disables the microhphone audio, though best practice is turn set both to the "ON" position when using handheld microhpones and to set both to the "OFF" position when handheld microphones are not in use.

The volume slider functions in the same manner as the volume slider in the speaker section, but instead allows you to adjust the microphone volume level. This is independent of the gain settings on the microphones themselves. Below is a diagram displaying the handheld microhpne system signal routing.

**Podium Mic**\
The modium mic section allows you to control the podium microhpone in the same way that you control the handheld microhopnes, with the exception that you do not need to physically turn on the podium microhpone itself. 

**Feedback**\
While rare, it is possible to generate a feedback loop with the center microphones. If you hear a feedback loop beginning, immediately shut off the speakers, presentation audio, and microphone inputs from the 4x4 CineNet tablets. Then, when the feedback has resided, slowly increase the level of each audio source until the appropriate volume has been reached.

# Video

Video settings and routing for the DRMC wall screens are similarly controlled using the Cinenet tablets.

**Selecting a Screen**\
By default, each CineMassive tablet is set to control one screen. However, these connections are not hardwired. By tapping "End Start 3x3 Presentation" or "End Start 4x4 Presentation," you will be brought to the CineNet landing page. Using the dropdown menu, you can choose whether you want that tablet to control the 3x3 screen or the 4x4 screen. After selecting a screen, tap "Start Presentation."

**CineNet Tablet Display**\
Along with volume and camera settings, you can alter display input settings for both the 3x3 and 4x4 using the 4x4 presentation mode. The 3x3 presentation mode, on the other hand, only allows you to adjust the 3x3 display input. While the 3x3 should generally be set to the 3x3 presentation mode for consistency's sake, setting both tablets to the 4x4 presentation mode can be useful during events if you need to adjust volume levels or other settings from behind the reference desk without interrupting the current speaker's presentation. If you have the 3x3 tablet set to the 4x4 presentation mode, you can change the 3x3 video settings by selecting "3x3 Video Wall" from the dropdown at the top of the screen.

**Layouts**\
The Layouts tab allows you to adjust how much of the display is used projecting the bravo computer screen. By default the screen is projected to the entire display. However, during events with attendees seated behind heach other in rows of chairs, it can be useful to shift the display off the bottom row of screens to provide attendees with a better view of the display. To change the displayed layout, tap the desired layout preset in the menu.

Custom layouts can also be created, allowing for the display of both the 3x3 and 4x4 bravos on the same screen in a variety of configurations.

**Assets**\
The assets tab is where you choose the display input for the video wall. In the 4x4 presentation mode, there are a number of inputs to choose from: 4x4 Bravo, 3x3 Bravo, two BYOD settings, etc.

To set the input, tap and drag the desired input source over the large orange box in the middle of the screen.

**DVR-CAM**\
The DVR-CAM tab allows you to control the camera on the pillar to the left of the Bellerby Globe. Tapping the up, down, left, or right arrows will pan the camera accordingly, and tapping the zoom in and out icons will adjust the camera's zoom level.

Below the pan and zoom controls are a number of preset positions. Tapping a number preset will pan/zoom the camera to the correspnding view. They are as follows:

1. Podium, zoomed in on the speaker
2. Screen and Podium
3. 3x3 Screen
4. 3x3 Screen, zoomed-out
5. Area just in front of the 4x4
