Here you will find directions on how to set up and close down the 3x3 and 4x4 wall screens before and after the DRMC's open hours.

# Setting Up

**3x3 Screen**\
Hit esc to take the screensaver image out of fullscreen mode and close the browser window. Open Chromium (the blue Google Chrome icon on the taskbar) and navigate to [davidrumsey.com](https://davidrumsey.com) (bookmarked as "The Collection").

**4x4 Screen**\
Hit esc to take the screensaver image out of fullscreen mode and close the browser window. Open Google Earth (the white paper file icon on the taskbar), zoom out until the entire globe is in the frame, and then set the globe to spin slowly.

# Closing Down

**3x3 Screen**\
Close out of any windows that may have been opened during the day. Open Google Chrome, navigate to [the screensaver image](/ws-screensaver) and click present to make the image full screen.

**4x4 Screen**\
Minimize or close out of Google Earth (if prompted to save temporary places you can click “Discard”), open Google Chrome and select the “DRMC Events” account when prompted. Navigate to [the screensaver image](/ws-screensaver) and click present to make the image full screen.
