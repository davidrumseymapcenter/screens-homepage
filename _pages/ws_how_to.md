Here you will find a guide on how to operate the DRMC wall screens and CineNet configuration tablets.

# Audio

All audio settings are found by selecting the "Audio" icon on the right-hand side bar of the CineNet tablets. Doing so will bring up a menu that looks like this:

## Audio Input

To change the source of the center speakers audio output, select the relevant input source from the list of inputs. "4x4" refers to the 4x4 bravo computer, and "BYOD" refers to any external computer plugged into the BYOD HDMI cable on the podium. 

If routing audio from BYOD, you may need to configure the audio output on the external computer by routing it through "Tesiraforte."

"WEPRESENT 1" through "WEPRESENT 6" refer to legacy devices that are left over from the system before the 2021 refresh. They are no longer operational.

## Presentation Audio

Below the input source list is a menu section labeled "Presentation Audio." This is where you turn speakers and microphones on and off and adjust their input and output levels.

### Speakers

The speaker section contains an on/off toggle and a volume slider. Flipping the toggle to "ON" will turn the center speakers on and flipping it to "OFF" will turn them off.

The volume slider allows you to adjust the master volume of the speakers themselves. You can either tap the volume up or volume down icons on either side of the slider to adjust the volume incrementally, or tap/tap and drag the slider itself to adjust the volume directly. 

Turning the volume slider all the way down functionally works the same as flipping the toggle to "OFF," though it is best practice to use the toggle instead of the slider to mute the center speakers.

### All Mics

Below the speaker section is the portable microphone section, which includes the all handheld microphones and lapel microphones. Note that handheld microhpnes must be charged and turned on for microphone audio to be passed to the center speakers. The "SPEAKERS" toggle in this section enables/disables passthrough of the microphone output to the center speakers, while the "MICROPHONES" toggle enables/disables the microphone input audio. Setting either of these toggles to "off" functionally disables the microhphone audio, though best practice is turn set both to the "ON" position when using handheld microhpones and to set both to the "OFF" position when handheld microphones are not in use.

The volume slider functions in the same manner as the volume slider in the speaker section, but instead allows you to adjust the microphone volume level. This is independent of the gain settings on the microphones themselves. Below is a diagram displaying the handheld microhpne system signal routing.

### Podium Mic

The modium mic section allows you to control the podium microhpone in the same way that you control the handheld microhopnes, with the exception that you do not need to physically turn on the podium microhpone itself.
