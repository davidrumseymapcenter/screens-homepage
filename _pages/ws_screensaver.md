[**DRMC Overnight Screensaver**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VLD1DQteF5fdRQ2xBjeqwhVvrGKBmRXoOJ1k6dmiZfg/edit#slide=id.p)

Use the Google Slides presentation linked above to close down the screens when the center closes. Open the link and click "Slideshow" (or Ctrl+F5) to make the image full screen.

The wall screen bravo computers are not designed to be routinely powered on and off. However, when they are not in use and the center is not open to the public, we open a screensaver to prevent the possibility of light damage to materials on display in the center.

Instead of using a black background, we use a dark (but still visible) background-- therefore, if the bravo computers shut down on their own overnight, center staff will be able to tell as soon as they arrive the next morning.
